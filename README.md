## Installations

**Download ChiTaH by using following command or Download as ZIP**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rajesh-Detroja/ChiTaH.git
```

**Download Bowtie2 index of pan-reference database and other reference files as follows:**

```bash
wget 
```

**Download test datasets as follows:**

```bash
wget 
```

<br></br>

## Setting up config file

Config files is provided in ChiTaH packaged names as `ChiTaH.txt`

After downloading ChiTaH and it's index of pan-reference database and other reference files, please replace <FULL_PATH> with the complete path in your system.

## How to use ChiTaH for paired-end datasets

**Example Fastq files:**

```text
sample_1.R1.fastq.gz

sample_1.R2.fastq.gz

sample_2.R1.fastq.gz

sample_2.R2.fastq.gz
```

**Run ChiTaH:**

```bash
bash ChiTaH.sh -1 .R1.fastq.gz -2 .R2.fastq.gz -c config.txt
```

That's it! This command will automatically run paired-end datasets of sample 1 and sample 2 and it will generated output matrix table in the file `all_chimeras.tsv`

## How to use ChiTaH for single-end datasets

**Example Fastq files:**

```text
sample_1.fastq.gz

sample_2.fastq.gz
```

**Run ChiTaH:**

```bash
bash ChiTaH.sh -1 .fastq.gz -c config.txt
```

That's it! This command will automatically run single-end datasets of sample 1 and sample 2 and it will generate output matrix table in the file `all_chimeras.tsv`
