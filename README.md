### A fast and accurate referenceâ€“based approach to identify known human chimeras or fusion genes

<br></br>

## Installations

**Download ChiTaH by using following command or Download as ZIP**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rajesh-Detroja/ChiTaH.git
```

**Download Bowtie2 index of pan-reference database and other reference files as follows:**

**[pan-reference](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ut34s3tnoqxwcv/pan_reference.zip?dl=0)**


**Download test datasets as follows:**

```bash
wget 
```

**Following dependencies must be installed and setuped in your system profile**

**[Bowtie2 -v 2.3.3.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/2.3.3.1/)**

**[sambamba -v 0.6.6](https://github.com/biod/sambamba/releases/tag/v0.6.6)**

After downloading ChiTaH and it's index of pan-reference database and other reference files, please replace <FULL_PATH> with the complete path in your system.

## How to use ChiTaH for paired-end datasets

**Test Fastq files:**

```text
hybrid_50.R1.fastq

hybrid_50.R2.fastq

hybrid_100.R1.fastq

hybrid_100.R2.fastq
```

**Run ChiTaH:**

```bash
bash ChiTaH.sh -1 .R1.fastq -2 .R2.fastq -c config.txt
```

That's it! This command will automatically run paired-end datasets of sample 1 and sample 2 and it will generated output matrix table in the file `all_chimeras.tsv`

## How to use ChiTaH for single-end datasets

**Test Fastq files:**

```text
hybrid_50.fastq

hybrid_100.fastq
```

**Run ChiTaH:**

```bash
bash ChiTaH.sh -1 .fastq -c config.txt
```

That's it! This command will automatically run single-end datasets of sample 1 and sample 2 and it will generate output matrix table in the file `all_chimeras.tsv`
